# books-clean-architecture

Welcome to the public repo for the [Clean Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/) book club. Over the next 14 weeks, we will be featuring a structured discussion of Robert C. Martin's 2012 book.

The book is available for free via safari online (check your local library for free access to the service). You should not find yourself limited in your ability to participate.

## Why Clean Architecture?

This book is both language and platform agnostic. The patterns and suggestions found inside should be broadly accessible and applicable to any software developer at any stage of career.

By reading together we can leverage the power of positive peer pressure and community to both stick-to-it and improve each others' learning through discussion.

## What to expect

Each week, we will discuss the contents of the assigned reading as listed above on the schedule. In some cases, these discussions will happen via twitch or YouTube chat.

Depending on turnout and participation, I will have additional materials to show, which should help catalyze the concepts discussed in the chapters.

You are welcome to come along and lurk, participate in Chat, follow along at your own pace by watching back the archived episodes on the "LGTM shipit" channel: https://youtube.com/c/lgtm-shipit.
